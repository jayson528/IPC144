i belive that findContactIndex and getTenDigitPhone helped clean up the code
alot. instead of having to print and scan every time we need to recive a 
number from the user we were able to just call that function and garrantee that
we are reciving a 10 digit number. and instead of having multiple loops inside
differant fuctions we can utilize the find index function to quickly find a
contact within the array.

i learned how to call functions and pass parameters to those functions. 
also how to call functions inside other functions to perform various tasks.
