1: I think the most important thing i learned from this workshop is how to 
perform calculations and how to store values in variables. i also learned how
to use the printf function.

2: we must add the .005 value in our equation for calculating the GST, because 
in the C compiler the numbers that we input will not get rounded correctly and
will give us incorrect calculations, in order to compansate for this we add the .005 so when the calculations are complete the final resut will be what we 
intended.

3: the result of the casting operation, if we use 8.68 as the input amount, will be 9.8134. but that amount displays to the user as 9.81 because we used the 
"%.2" in the code.

3: i belive we are supposed to use the MOD operator in order to learn how to use it,
it can also make your code more efficiant.
