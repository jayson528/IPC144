1)there is multiple way of adding information to the data field, some are more efficent than others. 
i belive if we write a differant program where we incorperate a switch statement, we can allow the user to add in which ever feilds they like, instead of having to go through entire
program. for example, you can give the user an option to add contact name, then using a switch statment, the user can choose to just enter 
the the phone number instead of having to input the contacts address and such.

2)when using a string in C, we must always add  one extra space for the null terminator.
for example, if we have a string that needs to hold up to 10 characters, we must make the char array
11 in order for the program to be able to fit in a null terminator so it knows when the string ends.
