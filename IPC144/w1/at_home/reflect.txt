1)In 3 or 4 sentences describe in your own words what you have learned in completing this work shop.

While i was working on the in lab and at home workshops, i have become more firmilar with using some of the
commands in linux, such as using the compiler command and other day to day use commands such as moving, creating,
renaming files and directories. i have also leanred how to use the #include and printf functions in the C 
language. through trial and error i have find the correct syntex to be able to complete the at home workshop
with out the need to have 3 seperate print functions, i have leanred to to use \n function to my advantage, hopefully
making my code easier to read to humans and possabily faster for the computer to execute.
